## Soulseek

### About
Soulseek is a very popular platform that is used by many music enthusiasts. It offers a bit-torrent like client and a peer to peer system dedicated to music. It is relatively simple to use this platform, but it has many downsides. 

**Pro's:**
* It is simple to use
* Wide collection of music available
* In-built chatrooms for discussions and more private tracks

**Con's:**
* Slow download speeds due to peer to peer system
* Mandatory to seed your tracks or you eventually get banned
* Boatloads of transcodes
* Lossy formats
* Most HQ tracks are pretty much locked by the seeder and requires you to exchange a track they need to get access to their albums.

### Using Soulseek

**Step-1:**
Download the [soulseek client](http://www.slsknet.org/news/node/1) and choose the right distribution 32 or 64 bit depending on your PC.

**Step-3:**
Now, you must first add your folder where you store your music tracks in order to share them to other users. In order to do that, head over to ```Options -> File Sharing -> Set share folder (Visible at the topmost tab)```, and select you're folder and set it as public if you want anyone to download or you can make it private if you want to restrict the access.
**Step-4:**
And, now that you're set, you can start searching for music albums. Use the search tab and enter the track name. In case you want a specific format add in the format along with the search. Once you get the results, you can download them. The downloads are shown at transfers tab. If you set a share folder, any file you upload to others will be shown in the same tab.
